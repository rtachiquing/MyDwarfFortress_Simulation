# My Dwarf Fortress Simulation

A Python-based simulation inspired by the popular game *Dwarf Fortress*, designed specifically for educational purposes in a **Data Structures and Algorithms** course. This project provides a hands-on approach to understanding and implementing advanced data structures and algorithms within the context of a simulation game.

## üìö Purpose

This project is an excellent resource for students learning data structures and algorithms. By integrating practical implementations of theoretical concepts, it bridges the gap between understanding and application. The project covers:

- **Linked Lists**: Standard, circular, and doubly linked lists.
- **Queues**: Normal, priority queues (heaps), and double-ended queues (deques).
- **Stacks**: For managing tasks and backtracking actions.
- **Sets**: Implementing a social network of characters.
- **Maps/Dictionaries**: Storing and retrieving dynamic character and game state attributes.
- **String Algorithms**: Pattern matching, string comparison, and compression algorithms.

Through this project, students explore the mechanics of these data structures and algorithms in a simulation that dynamically evolves based on their implementation.

So, this is a project aimed for study and have some fun with a practical implementations of some major topics in Data Structures and Algorithms.
This project isn't complete. You will find a mere initial code and some already implementations that try to help starting.

## üöÄ Features

### Current Implementation
1. **Characters and Social Network**
   - Each character belongs to a specific race (Dwarf, Elf, Human, etc.) and possesses unique attributes such as:
     - Name, age, gender, health status, and professions.
   - Characters interact with one another through a social network powered by **sets**, enabling features like:
     - Friendship networks.
     - Clan formation (union of sets).
     - Shared goals and collaborative tasks.

2. **Map and Resource Management**
   - A procedurally generated map with varying terrains and resources, stored in a **dictionary** for fast lookups.
   - Characters interact with the map to gather resources, build structures, or engage in other tasks.

3. **Task Management**
   - Tasks are organized using **priority queues**, with actions assigned based on character compatibility and urgency.
   - Characters use **stacks** to manage exploration and backtracking in environments like caves and mines.

4. **Animation and Visualization**
   - Visual feedback for character actions (e.g., chopping trees, mining, or trading).
   - A simple text-based console rendering of the map and tasks.

5. **Algorithms in Action**
   - **String pattern matching** for locating specific objectives or analyzing character interactions.
   - **Shortest path algorithms** like A* or Dijkstra for character movement and navigation.
   - Basic **compression techniques** to optimize storage for map states and logs.
